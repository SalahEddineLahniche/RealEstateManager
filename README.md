# a simple micro service with simplistic REST API

this project can be run using flask with the command
`set FLASK_APP=serever.py` in Windows
followed by `flask run`

You can use the html document attached `test.html` to go through all the functionalities.

Because there is no front end, the API is using GET in all its routing instead of the conventional verbs that includes POST, DELETE

Security isn't taken into account

the database is `sqlite3`
